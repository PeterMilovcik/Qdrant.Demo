# Module 6 — Advanced Chat

> **~15 min** · Builds on [Module 5](../module-05/README.md)

## Learning objective

By the end of this module you will have:

- Made the system prompt **customizable** per request
- Added **tag filtering** to the chat retrieval step
- Added a **score threshold** to exclude low-relevance context
- Understood how these controls affect answer quality

---

## Concepts introduced

### Custom system prompts

In Module 5 the system prompt was hard-coded. Now the caller can supply their own via the `systemPrompt` field. This lets the same endpoint serve different personas:

- A legal assistant: *"You are a legal advisor. Cite applicable statutes."*
- A customer support bot: *"Answer in a friendly tone. Suggest help articles."*
- A code reviewer: *"Review the code and suggest improvements."*

When `systemPrompt` is omitted, the default ("answer only from context") is used.

### Filtered retrieval

The `tags` field narrows which documents are retrieved as context. If you have thousands of documents across many categories, filtering ensures the LLM only sees relevant ones:

```json
{
  "question": "How does DNA replication work?",
  "tags": { "category": "biology" }
}
```

### Score threshold

The `scoreThreshold` field excludes low-similarity documents from the context window, even if they'd be in the top-K. This prevents the LLM from being distracted by irrelevant noise:

```json
{
  "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
  "k": 10,
  "scoreThreshold": 0.5
}
```

## What changed from Module 5

| Changed file | What changed |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Models/Requests.cs` | `ChatRequest` now has `ScoreThreshold`, `Tags`, and `SystemPrompt` parameters |
| `Endpoints/ChatEndpoints.cs` | Injects `IQdrantFilterFactory`; applies `req.Tags` and `req.ScoreThreshold` to search; uses `req.SystemPrompt ?? DefaultSystemPrompt` |

No new files — this is a refinement of the existing chat endpoint.

## Step 1 — Start Qdrant and run the API

```bash
cd module-06
docker compose up -d    # starts Qdrant + demo-api (http://localhost:8080)

# Option A: use the containerized API at http://localhost:8080
# Option B: run the API locally on a known port
cd src/Qdrant.Demo.Api
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:ASPNETCORE_URLS = "http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Step 2 — Index documents (if not already present)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"bio-001","text":"Photosynthesis converts sunlight into chemical energy in green plants.","tags":{"category":"biology"}}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"phys-001","text":"Quantum entanglement links two particles across any distance.","tags":{"category":"physics"}}'
```

## Step 3 — Custom system prompt

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me about photosynthesis",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a children'\''s science teacher. Explain everything as if speaking to a 7-year-old. Use simple words and fun analogies."
  }'
```

Compare this with the default prompt — same question, very different tone.

## Step 4 — Filtered chat

Only pull from biology documents:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me something interesting",
    "tags": { "category": "biology" }
  }'
```

The physics document is never seen by the LLM.

## Step 5 — Score threshold

Exclude weak matches:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "best pizza recipe",
    "scoreThreshold": 0.6
  }'
```

With a 0.6 threshold, no documents about biology/physics should pass. The LLM will respond that it has no relevant context.

## Exercises

### Exercise 6.1 — Persona switch

Call `/chat` three times with the same question but different system prompts: a formal academic, a pirate, and a haiku poet. Observe how the tone changes while the factual content stays the same.

### Exercise 6.2 — Combine all controls

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How do plants get energy?",
    "k": 3,
    "scoreThreshold": 0.4,
    "tags": { "category": "biology" },
    "systemPrompt": "Answer in exactly one sentence."
  }'
```

### Exercise 6.3 — Run the tests

```bash
cd module-06
dotnet test
```

You should see **30 tests passed**.

- [x] Customizable system prompts
- [x] Tag-filtered retrieval in the chat endpoint
- [x] Score threshold to exclude weak matches
- [x] Understanding of: persona control, filtered RAG, context quality tuning
