# Module 0 — Setup & Orientation

> **~15 min** · No LLM needed yet · No code to write

## Learning objective

By the end of this module you will have:

- Qdrant running in Docker
- A bare .NET API skeleton that connects to Qdrant and creates a collection at startup
- Swagger UI open in your browser
- The Qdrant Dashboard open for inspecting your data

---

## What you'll need open

Keep these three things visible throughout the workshop:

1. **Terminal** — to run commands
2. **Browser tab 1** — Qdrant Dashboard at `http://localhost:6333/dashboard`
3. **Browser tab 2** — Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger` (when running locally)

---

## Concepts introduced

### Qdrant — a vector database

**Qdrant** is an open-source vector database. It stores **points** — each point has:

- A **unique id** (UUID or integer)
- A **vector** (an array of floats — we'll use 1536 dimensions)
- An optional **payload** (key/value metadata)

Points live inside **collections**. A collection is like a database table — all vectors in a collection must have the same dimensionality.

In this module, we just create the empty collection. We'll add points starting in Module 1.

### The API skeleton

The `Program.cs` in this module is minimal:

- Reads Qdrant connection config from `appsettings.json` (with env-var overrides)
- Registers `QdrantClient` (the gRPC client for Qdrant)
- Starts `QdrantBootstrapper` — a background service that creates the `documents` collection at startup (with retries, since Qdrant may not be ready immediately)
- Exposes Swagger UI, a root info endpoint (`GET /`), and a health check (`GET /health`)

No LLM, no embeddings, no documents yet — just infrastructure.

---

## Step 1 — Start Qdrant

From this module's folder, start the Qdrant container:

```bash
cd module-00
docker compose up -d
```

Wait a few seconds, then verify Qdrant is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6333/healthz
```

You should see `ok` or similar. Open the **Qdrant Dashboard** in your browser:

👉 **http://localhost:6333/dashboard**

You'll see an empty dashboard — no collections yet.

## Step 2 — Run the API

In a separate terminal, run the API on a known port:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:ASPNETCORE_URLS = "http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
cd module-00/src/Qdrant.Demo.Api
dotnet run
```

You should see output like:

```
[bootstrap] Collection 'documents' ready.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
  Now listening on: http://localhost:8080
```

## Step 3 — Explore

### Swagger UI

Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger`.

You'll see two endpoints:
- `GET /` — returns service info (Qdrant config, collection name, embedding dimensions)
- `GET /health` — hidden from Swagger but reachable directly

Try calling `GET /` from Swagger — you should see the configuration JSON.

### Qdrant Dashboard

Go back to **http://localhost:6333/dashboard**. You should now see a `documents` collection listed. Click on it to explore — it's empty (0 points), but the collection is ready.

**Notice:**
- **Dimension:** 1536 (matching `text-embedding-3-small`)
- **Distance:** Cosine (we'll use cosine similarity for searching)

## Step 4 — Inspect the code

Open these files and read through them:

| File | What to notice |
|------|---------------|
| `Program.cs` | How config values are read with env-var fallbacks |
| `Services/QdrantBootstrapper.cs` | The retry loop (30 attempts, 1s apart) — tolerates Qdrant starting slowly |
| `appsettings.json` | Default Qdrant connection values |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Only Qdrant — the API runs locally via `dotnet run` |

## Exercises

### Exercise 0.1 — Verify the collection exists

Open the Qdrant Dashboard and confirm:
- The `documents` collection exists
- It has 0 points
- The vector dimension is 1536
- The distance metric is Cosine

### Exercise 0.2 — Call the info endpoint

Using curl or Swagger, call `GET /` and verify the response matches your configuration:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "service": "Qdrant.Demo.Api",
  "qdrant": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "http": 6333,
    "grpc": 6334,
    "collection": "documents",
    "embeddingDim": 1536
  }
}
```

### Exercise 0.3 — Restart and observe idempotency

Stop the API (`Ctrl+C`) and start it again. The bootstrapper will try to create the collection again — but since it already exists, the `AlreadyExists` gRPC exception is caught silently. Check the logs: you should see `Collection 'documents' ready.` without errors.

## ✅ Checkpoint

At this point you have:

- [x] Qdrant running in Docker with an empty `documents` collection
- [x] A .NET API skeleton with Swagger UI
- [x] The Qdrant Dashboard showing your collection
- [x] Understanding of: collections, points (conceptually), and the bootstrapper pattern

## 🧹 Clean Up

Before moving to the next module, stop everything started in this module:

1. **Stop the local API** — press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `dotnet run` is running
2. **Stop Docker containers** — from the `module-00` directory:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This ensures ports 8080, 6333, and 6334 are free for the next module.
