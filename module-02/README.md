# Module 2 — Similarity Search

> **~15 min** · Builds on [Module 1](../module-01/README.md)

## Learning objective

By the end of this module you will have:

- Understood **cosine similarity** and what search scores mean
- Used `POST /search/topk` to find documents similar to a query
- Observed how results are ranked by semantic relevance, not keyword matching

---

## Concepts introduced

### Cosine similarity

When you search, the API embeds your query text into a vector (just like indexing), then compares it against every stored vector using **cosine similarity**.

Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors:
- **1.0** = identical meaning (vectors point in the same direction)
- **0.0** = completely unrelated
- Values typically range **0.3 – 0.9** for real-world text

**Key insight:** This is *semantic* search, not keyword search. The query "How do plants make food?" will match a document about "photosynthesis" even though the words don't overlap — because their *meanings* are close in vector space.

### Top-K search

`POST /search/topk` returns exactly **K** results, ranked by cosine similarity (highest first). If K=3, you get the 3 most similar documents, regardless of how similar they actually are.

Use Top-K when you want a **fixed number of results** — like "show me the 5 most relevant documents."

## What changed from Module 1

| New file | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Extensions/QdrantPayloadExtensions.cs` | Converts gRPC payload to clean JSON for API responses |
| `Endpoints/SearchEndpoints.cs` | `POST /search/topk` — embed query → search Qdrant → return ranked hits |

| Changed file | What changed |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Models/Requests.cs` | Added `TopKSearchRequest` and `SearchHit` records |
| `Program.cs` | Added `MapSearchEndpoints(collectionName)` |

---

## Step 1 — Start Qdrant and run the API

```bash
cd module-02
docker compose up -d    # starts Qdrant (http://localhost:6333)
```

Then run the API locally:

```bash
cd src/Qdrant.Demo.Api
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:ASPNETCORE_URLS = "http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:8080"
```

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Step 2 — Index some documents

If you haven't already, index the sample articles using **Swagger UI**:

1. Open **http://localhost:8080/swagger** in your browser
2. Find the **POST /documents** endpoint and click it to expand
3. Click **Try it out**
4. Paste each JSON body below and click **Execute** (repeat for all three):

**Document 1:**

```json
{
  "id": "article-001",
  "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct."
}
```

**Document 2:**

```json
{
  "id": "article-002",
  "text": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become linked, so the quantum state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance."
}
```

**Document 3:**

```json
{
  "id": "article-003",
  "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed."
}
```

## Step 3 — Search!

In **Swagger UI**, find the **POST /search/topk** endpoint, click **Try it out**, paste the following body and click **Execute**:

```json
{
  "queryText": "How do plants produce energy from sunlight?",
  "k": 3
}
```

In the **Response body** you should see all 3 documents ranked by similarity:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "99561fa9-ef52-df51-bf9c-469607d4596e",
    "score": 0.64333606,
    "payload": {
      "indexed_at_ms": 1770831019588,
      "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct."
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "df45c345-85a8-6a5e-aa63-4bbf79fe3f21",
    "score": 0.0954015,
    "payload": {
      "indexed_at_ms": 1770831028172,
      "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed."
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "a6ea9a4f-e9a6-5c50-b678-3c016e58f96b",
    "score": 0.093406975,
    "payload": {
      "text": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become linked, so the quantum state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance.",
      "indexed_at_ms": 1770831023087
    }
  }
]
```

**Notice:** The photosynthesis article scores highest (~0.89) because it's semantically closest to the query. The other articles score much lower because they're about different topics. This is cosine similarity in action.

## Exercises

### Exercise 2.1 — Try different queries

Using **POST /search/topk** in Swagger UI, try each query below and observe which document scores highest:

**Query 1** — should match article-002 (quantum physics):

```json
{
  "queryText": "spooky action at a distance",
  "k": 3
}
```

**Query 2** — should match article-003 (ML/AI):

```json
{
  "queryText": "training algorithms on datasets",
  "k": 3
}
```

### Exercise 2.2 — Change K

In Swagger UI, try the same search with `"k": 1` to get only the single best match. Then try `"k": 10` — with only 3 documents indexed, you'll still get at most 3 results.

### Exercise 2.3 — Search for something unrelated

Using **POST /search/topk** in Swagger UI, try:

```json
{
  "queryText": "best pizza recipe",
  "k": 3
}
```

You'll still get 3 results (Top-K always returns K results if the collection has enough), but the scores will be noticeably lower. There's no "minimum relevance" filter yet — that comes in Module 4 (threshold search).

### Exercise 2.4 — Run the tests

```bash
cd module-02
dotnet test
```

You should see **11 tests passed**.

## ✅ Checkpoint

At this point you have:

- [x] A working `POST /search/topk` endpoint
- [x] Observed semantic search in action — meaning-based, not keyword-based
- [x] Understood cosine similarity scores
- [x] Understanding of: Top-K search, score interpretation, QdrantPayloadExtensions

## 🧹 Clean Up

Before moving to the next module, stop everything started in this module:

1. **Stop the local API** — press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `dotnet run` is running
2. **Stop Docker containers** — from the `module-02` directory:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This stops Qdrant so the next module starts fresh.
